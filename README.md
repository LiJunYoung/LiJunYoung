### Hi there, I'm YouRenJun（友人）. 👋



​	I am a front-end development engineer from China, you can call me friend or little friend. At present, I am developing Hongmeng mobile terminal software. I like open source and everything unknown and try it.
​	I want to be an interesting person and create something that others will remember.

- 🔭 I am currently learning arkTs language
- 🌱 I am currently studying backend development for node.js and want to become a full stack developer
- 🤔 I want to make a multi-terminal app with front and back end interaction, so as to exercise my front and back end skills in this app
- ❤️ I like anime, games, sleeping and doing unknown but interesting things
